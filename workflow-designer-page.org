The Workflow design page allows a user to easily create workflows to help
them with the automation of various tasks in their Workiom apps. The page
presents a flow-chart that contains a number of sequential cards. The cards
can possibly expand or show a popup to present additional information and
configuration options to the user.

There are currently three types of cards; A Trigger card, a Condition card,
and any number of Action (Task) cards.

* Trigger Card
  A trigger card is the rule that causes the workflow process to
  start. There are multiple types of triggers that the user can choose from,
  some with their own specific configurations. The types are:

** Create Record Trigger
   This trigger launches the workflow process when a record is created in
   the current list. This trigger type does not require any special
   configurations.

** Update Record Trigger
   This trigger launches the workflow process when a specific field in a
   record is updated in the current list. This trigger type requires the
   selection of the field which update will trigger the workflow. A list of
   the current list's fields should be presented for the user to select the
   desired field.

** Date-based Trigger
   This trigger launches the workflow process when a record's date value is
   reached (e.g. notify a user when a record's `Due Date` arrives). This
   trigger type requires the selection of the date field which should be
   watched. A list of the current list's date and date-time fields should be
   presented for the user to select the desired field.

* Condition Card
  A condition card allows the user to specify an additional condition to
  trigger the workflow. This card is optional, and allows the user to
  specify any formula expression using Workiom's [[https://workiom.com/knowledge-base/computed-field][formula language]]. The
  result of the formula expression should be a True or False
  value. Basically, if the condition passes, the workflow is triggered, but
  if the condition fails, then the workflow is not triggered.

  The conditional expression should be edited using a text area field. And
  the UI should allow the user to easily insert specific fields from the
  current list into the expression. Workiom already has a basic expression
  editor popup that is used in computed fields.

* Action Cards
  Action cards are the actual tasks the automation system will execute when
  the workflow is triggered. There are currently three types of possible
  actions, each with its own set of configurations.

** Create Record Task
   This task will create a new record in some list. It requires specifying
   the list we want to create the record in (which can be in another app,
   which means the user should optionally be able to select the app
   too). After selecting the list, the user should be presented with the
   list's field mappings, where they set the static values or dynamic source
   of values for each field that will be in the newly created record. See
   the [[Mappings]] section for more details.

** Update Record Task
   This task will update an existing record in some list. It requires
   specifying the list we want to create the record in (which can be in
   another app, which means the user should optionally be able to select the
   app too). After selecting the list, the user should specify what record
   to update, this can be in one of two ways:

   - Update a specific record in the target list, by selecting it from a
     auto-complete drop-box that helps them choose the record.

   - Update the first linked record in a linked field in the current
     list. Here, the user should be able to choose the linked field from
     which the update target record will be retrieved.

   After specifying the record that will be updated, the user should be
   presented with the list's field mappings, similar to the one in the
   Create Record Task, where they set the static values or dynamic source of
   values for each field that will be in the newly created record. See the
   [[Mappings]] section for more details.

** Notify User Task
   This task will send a notification message to a specific user in the
   current Workiom workspace. The user must specify the user to which the
   notification will be sent by either:

   - Selecting a static user to which the notification will always be
     sent. (e.g. send notifications to the admin when a project is
     finished).

   - Selecting a User field from the current list. The message will be sent
     to the user specified in the value of that field for the record that
     triggered the workflow. (e.g. send notification to a user when they are
     assigned to a task in the tasks list).

   In addition to selecting the target user, the user designing the workflow
   should set the text of the notification message using a text area.

* Mappings
  Field mappings are used to provide new values for each field in the
  created or updated records when using a Create Record or Update Record
  tasks. There two ways to obtain the value for a field:

  - Static values :: Static values are the simpler option where a user just
                     sets a specific value that all created or updated
                     records will use every time the workflow is triggered.

  - Dynamic values :: Dynamic values are obtained from fields in the current
                      list's record that triggered the workflow. The user
                      should be able to select the field that will provide
                      this value.

  The design of the mapping UI should be as close as possible to the current
  list filters UI, as users potentially will already be familiar with it.
